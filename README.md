This application calculates the convective heat transfer coefficient between two ship tanks with different cargoes
or between a tank and the environment, another ship space, or a void space. It selects the appropriate correlation
of characteristic heat transfer numbers, calculated based on user input. Each calculation is reported with an
explanation of the resulting tank configuration, the correlation used, and the results obtained. All the scientific
details are explained in the app in the help section.

This is my first code in Python, written just to try it out and without prior reading about OOP languages as such.
My interest in programming has its origins in small programs I wrote in VBA using Excel in a purely functional way,
and that's how this application is written too.

I'm only uploading it here because it's an actual, practical tool for calculating  convective heat transfer in ship
tanks, based in part on my own research in this area.

This was too much work for me to rewrite everything with a proper OOP approach. Of course, I'd make it much simpler
and more reliable now, and who knows, maybe I'll rewrite the code someday.
